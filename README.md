# PacManGame Rules
    The Model Component
    The model component represents the data and business logic of your game. In a Pac-Man game, this would include information about the game state, such as the position of Pac-Man and the ghosts, the state of the maze, the score, and the number of lives remaining. Here's how you can build the model component:

    Create a Python module for the model component.
    Define classes to represent the game state and the different game objects (e.g., Pac-Man, ghosts, dots, etc.).
    Implement methods to update the game state based on user input and other events (e.g., Pac-Man moving, Pac-Man eating a dot, Pac-Man colliding with a ghost, etc.).
    Define methods to access the current game state (e.g., Pac-Man's position, the score, etc.).

    The View Component
    The view component is responsible for displaying the game to the user. In a Pac-Man game, this would include the maze, the Pac-Man character, the ghosts, and the dots. Here's how you can build the view component:

    Create a Python module for the view component.
    Use a widget library like tkinter or Pygame to create the game window and drawing area.
    Define methods to draw the different game objects on the screen (e.g., the maze, Pac-Man, ghosts, dots, etc.).
    Implement methods to handle user input (e.g., arrow keys for moving Pac-Man).

    The Controller Component
    The controller component acts as the intermediary between the model and the view components, handling user input and updating the game state accordingly. Here's how you can build the controller component:

    Create a Python module for the controller component.
    Define methods to handle user input (e.g., arrow keys for moving Pac-Man).
    Use methods from the model component to update the game state based on user input and other events.
    Use methods from the view component to redraw the game on the screen after each update.

# Ghosts
    Position: The position of the ghost on the game board. This could be represented as a tuple of (x, y) coordinates.
    Direction: The current direction that the ghost is moving in. This could be represented as an integer value (e.g. 0 for up, 1 for right, etc.) or as a string value (e.g. "up", "right", etc.).

    Color: Each ghost in Pac-Man has a distinct color (e.g. red, pink, blue, orange). You may want to include an attribute to store the color of each ghost.

    Mode: The behavior of the ghosts changes depending on the mode of the game. For example, in the beginning of the game, ghosts are in scatter mode. After a certain amount of time, they switch to chase mode. You may want to include an attribute to store the current mode of the ghost.

    Speed: The speed at which the ghost moves on the game board. This could be represented as an integer value (e.g. number of pixels per second).

    Status: The status of the ghost (e.g. alive, dead, scared). This attribute would be useful for implementing the various behaviors of the ghosts depending on their status.

    Scatter target: When the ghosts are in scatter mode, they each have a specific target location that they try to reach. You may want to include an attribute to store the scatter target of each ghost.

    Chase target: When the ghosts are in chase mode, they each have a specific target location based on Pac-Man's position. You may want to include an attribute to store the chase target of each ghost.

    Vulnerability timer: When Pac-Man eats a power pellet, the ghosts become vulnerable for a certain amount of time. You may want to include an attribute to store the vulnerability timer for each ghost.

# Pacman
    Position: The position of Pac-Man on the game board. This could be represented as a tuple of (x, y) coordinates or as separate x and y attributes.

    Direction: The current direction that Pac-Man is moving in. This could be represented as an integer value (e.g. 0 for up, 1 for right, etc.) or as a string value (e.g. "up", "right", etc.).

    Lives: Pac-Man starts the game with a certain number of lives. You may want to include an attribute to store the current number of lives remaining.

    Score: Pac-Man earns points for eating pellets, fruits, and other objects on the game board. You may want to include an attribute to store the current score.

    Speed: The speed at which Pac-Man moves on the game board. This could be represented as an integer value (e.g. number of pixels per second).

    Status: The status of Pac-Man (e.g. alive, dead, invincible). This attribute would be useful for implementing the various behaviors of Pac-Man depending on his status.

    Power-up timer: When Pac-Man eats a power pellet, he becomes invincible for a certain amount of time. You may want to include an attribute to store the remaining time for the power-up.

    Power-up duration: The duration of the power-up effect. This could be represented as an integer value (e.g. number of seconds).

    Power-up score: Pac-Man earns extra points for eating ghosts when he is under the effects of a power-up. You may want to include an attribute to store the current power-up score.
